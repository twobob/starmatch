        <h3>Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations</h3>
        
        <div class="info-panel">
          <p>
            The EU Cookie Directive was implemented into UK law under the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) 
            (Amendment) Regulations 2011 which are themselves an amendment to the Privacy and 
            Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003.
          </p>
          <p>These regulations came into UK law on 26 May 2011.</p>

        <h2>WORDING OF THE UK REGULATIONS</h2>
        
        <div class="info-panel">
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
            There is one key section of the UK regulations that is relevant to website owners in respect of user consent:
          </p>
          
          <h4 style="color: var(--accent); margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Confidentiality of communications:</h4>
          
          <div class="regulation-item">
            <h5>6.—(1)</h5>
            <p>
              Subject to paragraph (4), a person shall not store or gain access to information stored, in the terminal 
              equipment of a subscriber or user unless the requirements of paragraph (2) are met.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="regulation-item">
            <h5>6.—(2)</h5>
            <p>
              The requirements are that the subscriber or user of that terminal equipment— (a) is provided with clear and 
              comprehensive information about the purposes of the storage of, or access to, that 
              information; and (b) has given his or her consent.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="regulation-item">
            <h5>6.—(3)</h5>
            <p>
              Where an electronic communications network is used by the same person to store or access information in the 
              terminal equipment of a subscriber or user on more than one occasion, it is sufficient 
              for the purposes of this regulation that the requirements of paragraph (2) are met in respect of the initial use.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="regulation-item">
            <h5>6.—(3A)</h5>
            <p>
              For the purposes of paragraph (2), consent may be signified by a subscriber who amends or sets controls 
              on the internet browser which the subscriber uses or by using another application or 
              programme to signify consent.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="regulation-item">
            <h5>6.—(4)</h5>
            <p>
              Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the technical storage of, or access to, information— (a) for the sole 
              purpose of carrying out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications 
              network; or (b) where such storage or access is strictly necessary for the provision of an information society 
              service requested by the subscriber or user.

        <h2>PLAIN ENGLISH INTERPRETATION</h2>
        
        <div class="info-panel highlight">
          <p style="font-size: 1.05rem;">
            You cannot store or gain access to information stored on a computer, 
            unless the user has been given clear and comprehensive information about what you want to do, 
            and why, and has given their consent to do so.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 1.05rem;">
            The exception to this rule is when the user requests a service and that service cannot be provided without 
            storing or gaining access to information stored on their computer.
