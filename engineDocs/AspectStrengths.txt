        It is useful to remember that an aspect is some subdivision of a
        circle:
        
        conjunction 1 division of 360 degrees:    value 1
        opposition 2 divisions of 360 degrees:    value 2
        trine 3 divisions of 360 degrees:         value 3
        square 4 divisions of 360 degrees:        value 4
        sextile 6 divisions of 360 degrees:       value 6
        semi-square 8 divisions of 360 degrees:   value 8
        semi-sextile 12 divisions of 360 degrees: value 12
        
        Using a different form for the numerical  values  obtained,  the
        table  can  be restated:  the values of the above aspects can be
        represented as a factor (which is an integer)  multiplied  by  a
        highest  prime  divisor.  For example, the highest prime divisor
        of 1 is 1, of 2, 2, of 3, 3, of 4, 2, of 6, 3, of 8, 2,  of  12,
        3....
        
        By  taking  the square root of the multiplying factor associated
        with each highest prime divisor we obtain a table of aspect val-
        ues with interesting properties:
        
        ASPECT      DIVISION  FACTOR  HIGHEST  EXPRESSION        1/VAL.
                    OF CIRCLE         PRIME    VALUE
                                      DIVISOR
        
        conjunction  1        1       1        1*sqrt(1) = 1     1
        opposition   2        1       2        2*sqrt(1) = 2     0.5
        trine        3        1       3        3*sqrt(1) = 3     0.33
        square       4        2       2        2*sqrt(2) = 2.83  0.35
        sextile      6        2       3        3*sqrt(2) = 4.24  0.24
        semi-square  8        4       2        2*sqrt(4) = 4     0.25
        semi-sextile 12       4       3        3*sqrt(4) = 6     0.17
        
        It  is of  interest  to  note that  neither  the quincunx  nor
        sesqui- quadrate aspects can  be satisfactorily represented by
        the above scheme - and the quincunx at least has traditionally
        been  re- garded  as a  'rogue', whose  influence is  entirely
        variable  but   usually  unsettling  or   disturbing,  neither
        positive   nor  negative.    However,  150   degrees  can   be
        represented as one-twelfth of (5  x 360 degrees): the quincunx
        is  thus  an  integer  subdivision  of  5  circles,  not  one;
        similarly,  the sesquiquadrate  is expressible  as an  integer
        submultiple of 24 circles. At any rate, their consideration as
        somehow  being   different  from   the  other   aspects  seems
        justified.  These   two  latter   aspects  are   perhaps  best
        considered as  'harmonics' of some  kind (perhaps the  work of
        John Addey is  of relevance here, although I  have not studied
        it).  Their effect is traditionally considered as weak.

	The quincunx  aspect is not  capable of being expressed  as an
	integer  subdivision of  a single  circle. It  is probably  of
	later  development than  the other  aspects, which  are easier
	visualised.  It  can be expressed  in the format of  the table
	above by noting that 150  degrees is an integer subdivision of
	5 rotations, not one:
	
	quincunx 12 divisions of 5 x 360 degrees
	
	The numerical value  associated with this aspect  is still 12,
	as for the semi-sextile, but is here effectively rescaled by a
	factor  of  5.   Consequently   the  nominal  aspect  strength
	calculated must be  reduced by this factor.  The highest prime
	divisor is still 3 but now the factor is 4/5, hence
	
	quincunx     12/5     4/5      3       3*sqrt(4/5) = 2.68 0.37
	
	i.e  it has  strength  slightly greater  than  the square  but
	considerably less than the opposition.  This intepretation is,
	of course, arguable.
	
        Rearranging these into order of 1/expression value we obtain
        
        		1 conjunction
        		2 opposition
			3 quincunx
        		4 square
        		5 trine
        		6 semi-square
        		7 sextile
        		8 semi-sextile
        
        and here the order of the aspects in terms of their strengths is
        exactly as given by the ancients (excepting the later quincunx),
	where the  negative  aspects are taken to  be stronger than  the
	corresponding positive ones (it is easier to notice what's wrong
	with something than what's  right: negative indicators appear to
	be more specific pointers).
        
        The  above  system of allocating numerical values to the aspects
        is the one used by the author and employed in  conjunction  with
        the point-scoring system of chart numerical analysis.
       
        In  order  to use the above table of aspect strengths, since nu-
        merically the aspect values increase going down the list (as the
        aspects become traditionally weaker), the reciprocals of the as-
        pect strengths are used as multiplying factors.
        
        For practical use inexact aspects are the norm; aspect  strength
        is therefore taken to be related to both the strength of the as-
        pect (as in the above list) and the amount by which the particu-
        lar aspect differs from its maximum allowable orb, expressed as
        
        chart aspect strength = ((1 / full aspect strength)
			      x (1 - (error in aspect / orb of aspect)))
        
        for example:  if Venus opposition Jupiter in a chart  has  value
        175 degrees, then the error in this aspect is taken as the abso-
        lute value of the difference between this value and that  repre-
        senting  the  exact  aspect, i.e. | 175 - 180 | = 5 degrees.  If
        the orb allowed for the  opposition  is  9  degrees,  since  the
        strength of the opposition is 1/2, the above expression becomes
        
        opposition strength = ((1/2) x (1 - (5 / 9))) = (0.5) x (0.44) =
        0.22
        
        which value is substituted wherever that  particular  opposition
        occurs in determination of the strength of some particular theme
        in a numeric chart.  Where planets such as the Sun or  Moon  are
        allocated  a value of 2 in the numeric chart, this is applied as
        a further multiplying factor to the aspect  strength  calculated
        above.  Thus, the Sun opposition Jupiter might have a value of 2
        x 0.22 = 0.44, reflecting the greater importance of the  Sun  as
        compared to Venus.  This is the  only concession  made to numer-
        ically representing individual planet strengths in the method of
        numerical astrology, and one which perhaps should be more deeply
        studied [see Ptolemy's discussion of exaltation and  fall].   Is
        it  sensible  to  allocate  the  same value - unity - to all the
        planets (other than the Sun and Moon) - or should these be vari-
        able;  and  in this case, should not gravity play a part - which
        itself poses the question:  is the mass an important factor  (in
        which  case the effect of the planets would be vanishingly small
        compared to that of the Sun) - or is it simply that a planet  is
        representative  of  a  particular region of personality or being
        (in which case the allocation of the same value to  all  planets
        would  be  acceptable).   This is fundamentally a question as to
        whether it is the orientation in the continuum of the  point  of
        origination  which  is  of  prime importance, the planets merely
        serving as markers to some region or qualifying it in  some  re-
        spect.
