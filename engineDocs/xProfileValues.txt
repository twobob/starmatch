xProfile output values -  an interpretation (from statistically insignificant data).


The basis of relationship type is indicated as follows:

	1	|------		similarity
		|
		|
		|
	0	|------		equality
		|
		|
		|
	-1	|------		complementarity

Positive values indicate increasing similarity, negative ones increasing
complementarity. relationships may be based on either, but Longer-
lasting or more significant ones are emphasised by the results being a
balance between similarity and complementarity, the results being nearer
to zero. The original postulation and indeed experientially, it seems 
that extreme left or right placings are those with whom, though a good 
relationship may occur, will not likely be 'partners'.

Those whose charts are similar in broad respects have charts of the same
shape as the subject; those with complementary charts have shape inverted
relative to the subject, is another observation.
